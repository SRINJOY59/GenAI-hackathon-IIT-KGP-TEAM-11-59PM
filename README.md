Question Answering and Text Generation Repository
This repository contains implementations of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) models and applications for question-answering, image description generation, stable diffusion, PDF question answering, and CSV question answering. These models leverage Mistral API, IDEFICS 9B, Stable Diffusion, Google Gemini API, RAG, and Google TAPAS.

Models and Implementations
Mistral API for General Question Answering:

Utilized the Mistral API for handling a wide range of general question-answering tasks.
IDEFICS 9B for Generating Image Descriptions:

Implemented IDEFICS 9B for generating textual descriptions from images.
Stable Diffusion using Model "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4":

Employed the Stable Diffusion model for image processing with the specified model ID.
PDF Question Answering using Google Gemini API and RAG:

Combined Google Gemini API and RAG for question answering from PDF documents.
CSV Question Answering using Google TAPAS:

Implemented question answering from CSV files using Google TAPAS from Hugging Face.
Langchain Vector Store for Text Similarity:

Created a vector store using Langchain for similarity searches based on text.
Gradio Applications
Deployed interactive Gradio applications for:

Mistral API-based question answering
Stable Diffusion image processing
CSV question answering with Google TAPAS
